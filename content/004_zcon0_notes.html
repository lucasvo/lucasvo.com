        <h2>The State of ZApps First Edition — ZCon0 Conference Notes</h2>
        <p>
           Zcash has for a long time had a very special place in my heart because of that. They’ve managed to bring zkSNARKs to the masses and built a cryptocurrency with working privacy. Zcash won’t be the only blockchain using zero knowledge proofs to enable privacy, but they are definitely the first. I’m very happy to report my highlights from Zcon0 last week in Montreal.

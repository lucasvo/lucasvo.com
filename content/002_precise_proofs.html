        <h2>Introducing Precise-Proofs: Create &amp; Validate Field-Level Merkle Proofs</h2>
        <p>
        Our Go library for a standardized way to create Merkle trees &amp; proofs for field level data of complex data structures. 
        In the article below, we are outlining how we are building this standard and some of the thoughts behind the technical decisions.
